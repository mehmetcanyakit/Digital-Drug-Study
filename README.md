# AI-Powered Drug Repurposing Using Literature-Based Digital Twins

Given the substantial resource demands of drug discovery, computational methods can offer a compelling strategy for reducing
resource requirements, facilitating the cost-effective identification of promising drug candidates before costly clinical trials. In
this study, we leverage a large volume of biomedical literature to utilize the contextual knowledge encoded in medical research
papers through previously extracted biomedical predications. Specifically, we construct a biomedical knowledge graph that
comprises therapeutically relevant associations among various biomedical entities to yield a robust framework for identifying
potential drug candidates. Later, we perform relational graph convolution operations on the knowledge graph to generate a
digital twin of each drug entity, which provides digital representations of the entities by incorporating their local associations
among neighbor entities. Our evaluation demonstrates that these digital drug representations can effectively predict potential
drug-disease associations with high accuracy. Ultimately, the proposed literature-based digital twin approach offers a promising
avenue for accelerating the identification of novel therapeutic candidates through data-driven analysis of biomedical literature.
